# O.U. Confidential
O.U. Confidential is a reddit-like forum website that allows Oakland University students to anonymously chat anxiety-free.

# About
I created this website for an honors college class in my first semester of at Oakland University, Fall 2023. I used Next.js 14's server actions, server components, and dynamic routes to facilitate a highly performant and easy-to-use forum. I also managed a cloud PostgreSQL database with Supabase containing user information as well as board, post, and comment data.

A note: the Supabase instance is oftentimes paused due to inactivity. The screenshots give a good idea of what everything looks like, but if the server is not working, and you would like to try it, shoot me a message!
