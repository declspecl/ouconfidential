# About
I created this website for an HC1000 project in my first semester of college, fall 2023. I used Next.js 14's server actions, server components, and dynamic routes to facilitate a highly performant and easy-to-use CMS. I also managed a cloud PostgreSQL database with Supabase containing user information as well as board, post, and comment data.
